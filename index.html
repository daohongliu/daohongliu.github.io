            <h2>Hi,</h2>
            <p>My name is David Liu. I do Mathematics and Computer Science at Corpus Christi College, University of Oxford.
                I'm the competitive programming officer at <a href="https://ox.compsoc.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oxford CompSoc</a>
                and I work as a
                <a href="https://www.ccc.ox.ac.uk/study-here/undergraduate-study/subject-ambassadors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">subject ambassador</a>
                at my college.
            </p>
            <p>You can contact me by email at
                <a href="mailto:whatisdavidevendoing@gmail.com">whatisdavidevendoing@gmail.com</a>
                - I'd love to hear from you!
            </p>
            <p>Outside of my degree, I spend a lot of time on things like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Writing little programs to automate annoyances or amuse friends</li>
                <li>Taking long walks around Oxford while listening to podcasts or just thinking</li>
                <li>Playing around with LLMs and chatting with AI (sometimes for longer than I'd like to admit)</li>
                <li>Rewriting the same paragraph over and over until it sounds exactly right</li>
                <li>Reading Chinese Poetry</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I'm also sympathetic to the Rationalist and <a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/">Effective Altruist</a> movements. I've been thinking seriously 
                about how to do good with both time and money, and I've signed the <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge">Giving What We Can</a>ðŸ”¸trial pledge to donate 5% of my income to high-impact charities.</p>
            <p>If you'd prefer not to email me directly, you're very welcome to leave anonymous 
                feedback <a href="https://admonymous.co/david-liu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. Even small thoughts 
                or suggestions can make a real difference and I'm always grateful for anything you take the time to share.</p>
